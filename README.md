<!-- This is the readme file for The Odin Project recipe project. 

For this assignment I stated by creating a standard recipe, but I changed to a fantasy theme and created potion recipes. 
The index page contains a level 1 heading and three unordered links. 

Each potion recipe contains a level 1 heading and level 2 headings. There is a paragraph in each recipe to describe the potion effects. 
In the Dragonsbane recipe I used the <strong> tag to emphasise the number of uses. 

Each recipe has an image file at the top of the page. To increase consistency within each recipe I added the width attribute and set each pixel width to 250. I also made sure to use a decriptive alt tag in each recipe -->
